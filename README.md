# 1000by2025 | dkBuilds Goal Tracker

A minimalist web application to track progress towards generating $1000 in net revenue by the end of 2025, while also serving as a POC for Stripe web app payments. Each dollar contributed (through Stripe) is a fun way to become a part of the journey, with real-time notifications and interactive visualizations showing the path to the goal.

## About

This project tracks dkBuilds' north star metric for 2025: to create $1000 in revenue. Why? Because the biggest indicator of product value is if people are willing to pay for it. This builds on last year's goal of reaching 1000 users, which proved we can build and release products that people use. Now, we're focused on creating genuine value that people find worth paying for.
